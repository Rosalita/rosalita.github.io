My name is Rosie Hamilton and I am a technophile, I love new technology.

I'm also a autodidact. I have taught myself many wonderful things and hold the belief that I can learn anything I set my mind to.

My current day job is working as a Senior Test Engineer on financial software projects.

Outside of work I write code in Go & R. I really enjoy tech meetups and talking to new people.   

As well as this blog, I also write about testing software at [Mega Ultra Super Happy Software Testing Fun Time](http://testingfuntime.blogspot.co.uk/)

## Some of my favourite things are:

* Cats
* Crafting
* Computers
* Computer games
* Golang
* Learning new things
* Public Speaking
* Violin
* Writing
* Yoga

Each day is a gift that I make the most of, taking the good with the bad and the happy with the sad.
