My name is Rosie Hamilton and I love computers and new technology.

I like to learn and teach myself things. I hold the belief that I can learn anything I set my mind to.

My current day job is as a backend Software Developer working with Go, AWS, Continuous Deployment and Serverless Lambdas.

Outside of work I enjoy yoga, arts & crafts, computer and card games. I really enjoy tech meetups and talking to new people.   

Before I became a Software Developer I spent a lot of time working as a Software Tester and writing about Software Testing at [Mega Ultra Super Happy Software Testing Fun Time](http://testingfuntime.blogspot.co.uk/)
